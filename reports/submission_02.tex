\section*{UI}
The first thing the user sees when they log in is the main application, which consists of the swiping module. When the user is not logged in, they see a public version of the navbar: \\

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=.4]{screen_00}}

\pagebreak

\noindent Once logged in, then the navbar switches to the private version and the user can access other features of the web application: \\

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=.4]{screen_01}}

\pagebreak

\noindent If the user clicks on the item image, they open a popup with more information on the item. Currently it is in a new page, but we intend to display it as a javascript popup: \\

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=.4]{screen_03}}

\pagebreak

\noindent Clicking on the "Sell Item" button on the navbar brings the user to a form where they can submit an item to sell: \\

\pagebreak

\noindent Clicking on the "Trending" button on the navbar brings the user to a page where they can browse through items that are currently trending, sorted by category. Clicking on a category allows the user to see more: \\

\pagebreak

\noindent On the right side of the navbar, the message button brings the user to a chat interface where the user can interact with potential buyers and sellers: \\

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=.4]{screen_04}}

\pagebreak

\noindent Hovering over the profile picture on the far right side of the navbar displays a drop down menu which contains some administrative links, one of which is the user profile settings: \\

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=.4]{screen_06}}

\pagebreak

\noindent Another administrative link that the user has access to is the item management page, which allows the user to administrate the items that they have for sale: \\
